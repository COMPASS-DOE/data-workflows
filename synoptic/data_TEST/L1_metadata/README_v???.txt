DESCRIPTION
—----------------------------------
Level 1 (L1) data are close to raw, although they have been units-transformed
and have out-of-instrument-bounds and out-of-service flags added.
Duplicates are removed but otherwise these data are not filtered,
and have not been subject to any additional algorithmic or human QA/QC.
Any use of L1 data for science analyses should be performed with care.
