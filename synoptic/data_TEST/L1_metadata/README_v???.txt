COMPASS-FME Level 1 data version [VERSION]
Date: [DATESTAMP]

# DESCRIPTION

Level 1 (L1) data are close to raw, although they have been units-transformed
and have out-of-instrument-bounds and out-of-service flags added.
Duplicates are removed but otherwise these data are not filtered,
and have not been subject to any algorithmic or human QA/QC.
Any use of L1 data for science analyses should be done with care.
