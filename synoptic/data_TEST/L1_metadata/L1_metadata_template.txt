General information
—----------------------------------
L1 data are close to raw data, although they have been units-transformed and 
have a single out-of-instrument-bounds flag applied. True duplicates are removed 
but otherwise these data are not filtered, and have not been subject to any algorithmic
or human QA/QC. Any use of these data for science analyses should be done with care.
