COMPASS-FME Level 1 sensor data
Version: [VERSION]
Date: [DATESTAMP]
Observations: [OBSERVATIONS]
Git commit: [GIT_COMMIT]

DESCRIPTION
—----------------------------------
This is the Level 1 (L1) data release [VERSION] for COMPASS-FME
environmental sensors located at field sites in the Lake Erie and
Chesapeake Bay regions. L1 data are close to raw, but are
units-transformed and have out-of-instrument-bounds and out-of-service
flags added. Duplicates and missing data are removed but otherwise these
data are not filtered, and have not been subject to any additional
algorithmic or human QA/QC. Any scientific analyses of L1 data should be
performed with care.

DATA STRUCTURE
—----------------------------------
Data are organized into {SITE_YEAR} folders, with up to 12 monthly
comma-separated value (CSV) files in each folder for each plot at that
site. Sites include CRC (Crane Creek), GCW (GCReW), GWI (Goodiwn
Island), MSM (Moneystump Marsh), OWC (Old Woman Creek), PTR (Portage
River), SWH (Sweet Hall Marsh), and TMP (TEMPEST experiment). See
site-specific metadata files in each folder.

Data are normally logged at a 15 minute interval, but this is **not** 
guaranteed. In particular, there may be:
* Missing data points (due to offline sensors, for example);
* Multiple observations for a given timestamp (rare, but this can occur at TEMPEST);
* Less-than-15-minute time intervals, in particular during TEMPEST flood events.

CHANGELOG
—----------------------------------
Version 1-0 released 2024-05-29
* Covers late 2019 through April 2024 for TEMPEST and all synoptic sites
* Restructured for ease of use, with metadata (location, sensor ID, etc) in separate columns
* SWH plot naming reworked for new upland plot
* Mirroring TMP C to GCW UP for synoptic site consistency
* GCReW weather station variables are now included in GCW-W 
* Many fixes to variable units and bounds
* Out-of-service is valid for AquaTROLL and EXO

Version 0-9 released 2024-01-22
* Preliminary release covering all synoptic site and TEMPEST data collected to date
* Units and bounds (and thus OOB flags) are missing for some ClimaVue, AquaTROLL, and Sonde variables
* Some research_name assignments for may incorrect for ClimaVue
* Out-of-service is working only for AquaTROLL
* No TEMPEST 1- or 5-minute data included
