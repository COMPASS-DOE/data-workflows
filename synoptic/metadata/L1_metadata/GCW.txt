GCREeW (GCW) is one of COMPASS-FME synoptic sites, and has three plots:
upland (located at 38.8741N, 76.5522W), transition (38.8745N, 76.5515W),
and wetland (38.8750N, 76.5500W). This transect spans a
mid- to late-successional (~80 years old) temperate, deciduous coastal
forest and a mesohaline marsh along the Rhode River in Edgewater, MD.

Important note: GCW upland (UP) is the TEMPEST control (C) plot, and so the 
data for GCW-UP in this folder are copied from (and identical to) TMP-C;
this means they differ in some respects from the other synoptic plots' data.
