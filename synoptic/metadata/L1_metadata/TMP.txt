TMP is TEMPEST, the COMPASS-FME ecosystem-scale flooding experiment and
has three 2000 m2 plots: control ("C"; located at 38.8747N, 76.5519W),
freshwater ("F"; 38.87403N, 76.5516W), and saltwater ("S"; 38.8744N,
76.5525W). The TEMPEST experiment is in a mid- to late-successional (~80
years old) temperate, deciduous coastal forest.

NOTE: Meteorological data for TEMPEST are available in the GCW-W files
and are from the GCReW met station. See notes in the GCW metadata.

The TEMPEST flood events occurred on the following dates. They
lasted for ~10 hours each day and delivered ~80,000 gallons to each plot;
many data streams are available at 1 or 5 minute frequency during these periods.
* Tests: Aug 25 (fresh plot) and Sep 9 (salt plot), 2021
* TEMPEST 1: June 22, 2022
* TEMPEST 2: June 6-7, 2023
* TEMPEST 3: June 11-13, 2024
